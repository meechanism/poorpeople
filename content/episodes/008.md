# Money is hard

A delayed release (recorded last year) of the first part of our Money segment.

This segment will be released in multiple parts, with this first part focusing on how we developed our relationship with money at a young age—how our families used it, how we learned to save (or not save) it, and how those habits shaped and influenced how we spend and save our money today.

This episode highlights some differences between our parents’ attitudes towards money and our current attitudes.

Are the differences generational? Between working and middle/upper-middle class? Immigrant and American-born? Let us know your thoughts!
