# BAHN MI ? ? ?

A recording of a casual chat we had one day about food and how Asian food in particular has become more mainstream in recent years.

We share some frustrations about how popular culture has influenced businesses to appropriate and try to capitalize on Asian foods, and we also discuss where the line is between what is considered respectful appreciation of a cuisine and what is appropriation/exploitation.

Honestly, most of the conversation is Jackie raging about how much she hate how people misspell and mislabel things as "banh mi".
