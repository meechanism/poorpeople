Nobody knew that health care could be so complicated! Just kidding, we did. Mee and Jackie kick off part 1 of 2 episodes that Poor People dedicates toward discussing healthcare in the United States. They go through their own experiences as kids, then later as adults, and talk about all the complicated issues that can come with having an employer-based healthcare system, especially in todayâ€™s world with COVID-19.

## Some funny editor notes

Definitely had a key learning point: Phones should be turned off and put in another room! Had to edit out those pesky ring tones and vibrations.
