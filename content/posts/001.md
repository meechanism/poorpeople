Welcome to the very first episode of Poor People, the podcast started by friends Mee and Jackie! They hope to give a platform to people of color to share their experiences and share helpful information.

In this episode, Mee and Jackie introduce their podcast to the audience by focusing on their respective backgrounds--how they grew up, where they went to school, and where they are today.
