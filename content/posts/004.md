## Episode 4 is out the door!

Whew, I know I mentioned in my last email that our Part 2 would be out soon, but alas, things always sporadically come up. My apologies!

Mee has done a wonderful job of dealing with the editing all of our episodes thus far, and the last one was full of fun things to edit out--like my dog barking at inopportune moments and either of forgetting something that we had researched previously that week. We really appreciate everyone's patience and support! The feedback we've received has been great and the constructive criticism has been really helpful for us to adjust and further shape our episodes. All right, without further ado, the new content!

In Part 2 of our healthcare-oriented chats, we talk about the healthcare systems in Sweden, Canada, and Taiwan to compare and contrast with our own in the United States. We also talk about the nuances of the American healthcare system with HSAs, FSAs, and all the things in between.
