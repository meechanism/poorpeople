First and foremost, I hope you are healthy and safe during this crisis. This is a hard time for people of all walks in life, so please continue to be mindful of people around you and for your safety.

Wow. I just spent the last two weeks researching how2podcast, purchase recording equipment, looked at software setup, rearranged stuff on my desk, made social media accounts, and not to mention logistics. Poor People is becoming real.

The other weekend I spent some time with Jackie outlining our first episode, breaking down subtopics to the minute. We decided to aim for durations between 45 minutes to an hour max. We made the bold assumption our topics were dense enough to have expanded discussions and also enough engaging content to keep the listener's focus.

We hope this is true!

Today I'm continuing to create the website and adding much-needed content explaining the purpose and core values of Poor People. We were initially supposed to meet yesterday to trial remote recording, but Jackie wasn't feeling mentally well. I think mental fortitude is also a topic we should bring up in a future broadcast because (going to make a bold statement here) it's not something we talk about as Asian Americans with our new immigrant parents.

This is a healthy lead to the topic of episode one: Our upbringing, who we are, and how we think it shaped our current political thinking.

I hope you are excited for what is to come because I certainly am!
