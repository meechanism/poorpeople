We realized we forgot to record the purpose of our podcast for episode one, so we spent time today to do it. Here is the outline we used.

- Mee: What happened and what sparked the start of the project
- Jackie: Goal of the podcast (eg: inform people/pass on information to others)
- Mee: Our values (how we want to shape our conversations)
- Jackie: Audience
- Jackie: Disclaimers, experience based
- Mee: Stuff we wish we knew at various stages of life and more disclaimers

We are not experts. ;)

After editing the recording, I exported it as a .WAV file and imported it into [Auphonic](https://auphonic.com/) to normalize some sound. I've been listening to the podcast too much lately and I don't have a good ear for sound, so I can't tell the difference much. Will this get better over time? I hope so! Here are some stats.
