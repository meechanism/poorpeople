Mee was born and raised in northern California from refugees parents of the Vietnam War. She grew up in an extremely sheltered childhood, escaped as the first woman in her family to attend university away from home, getting a degree in the STEM field, and is now working professionally in the technology industry as a software engineer.

Mee believes the struggles of her family living in a different society and having to adjust to the new norms have shaped her empathy and understanding of those also struggling in economic and social spaces. She wants to build a platform for her and others to share conversations with different perspectives about societal issues and to give back to the community by answering questions and discussing topics of financial wellness within the people of color space.
