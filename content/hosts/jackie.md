Jackie is a Vietnamese American woman whose parents immigrated to the United States as refugees of the Vietnam War. She grew up in a single-parent household, which she attributes for her keen sense of independence and curiosity that helped her navigate through new and challenging situations. She is the first person in her family to graduate from college, and she currently works in the tech industry.

Over the years, Jackie has had access to various opportunities and different tools and knowledge that she wishes she knew about while growing up. After living in 3 different states and traveling to many other ones, she has collected several interesting stories about the Asian American experience (not everywhere is like the Bay Area!). She hopes that listeners find her experiences shared on this platform to be useful (at least somewhat!) to help navigate todayâ€™s world, particularly in the fields of education and civil/community action as a POC.
